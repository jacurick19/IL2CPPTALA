# IL2CPPTALA
IL2CPPTALA(IL2CPPTakeALookAt)is for gathering information about Unity applications.

Place the application in a directory with (unzipped) Unity games and run 
```python parser.py o```
An output file will discuss information about any files known to contain a 'global-metadata.dat' file, and some statistics will be printed upon the conclusion of the execution. This may run slow with many directories. 

Other outputs are possible and in development, but are not yet fully operational for all versions of the metadata file.
